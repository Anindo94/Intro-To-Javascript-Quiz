Quiz-1
Write a while loop that:

Loop through the numbers 1 to 20
If the number is divisible by 3, print "Julia"
If the number is divisible by 5, print "James"
If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "JuliaJames"
If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number

Code:

var x = 1;

while (x <=20) {
    if (x%3 === 0 && x%5 === 0) {
        console.log("JuliaJames");
    }
    else if (x%5 === 0) {
        console.log("James");
    }
    else if (x%3 === 0){
        console.log("Julia");
    }
    else {
        console.log(x);
    }
    x=x+1;
    }

Quiz-2
Write a loop that prints out the following song. Starting at 99, and ending at 1 bottle.

99 bottles of juice on the wall! 99 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 98 bottles of juice on the wall!
98 bottles of juice on the wall! 98 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 97 bottles of juice on the wall!
...
2 bottles of juice on the wall! 2 bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 1 bottle of juice on the wall!
1 bottle of juice on the wall! 1 bottle of juice! Take one down, pass it around... 0 bottles of juice on the wall!

Code:
 var num = 99;

while (num >=0) {
       if  (num > 2) {
           sub=num - 1;
           console.log(num +" bottles of juice on the wall! " + num+ " bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... "+ sub + " bottles of juice on the wall!");
       }
        else if (num == 2){
            sub=num - 1;
           console.log(num +" bottles of juice on the wall! " + num+ " bottles of juice! Take one down, pass it around... "+ sub + " bottle of juice on the wall!");
        } 
        else if (num === 1) {
            sub=num - 1;
           console.log(num +" bottle of juice on the wall! " + num+ " bottle of juice! Take one down, pass it around... "+ sub + " bottles of juice on the wall!");
        }
           num = num - 1;
    }

    console.log("hello " + x);
}

Output:
hello 9
hello 8
hello 7
hello 6
hello 5
hello 4
hello 3
